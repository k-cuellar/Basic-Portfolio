*THINGS THAT ARE MISSING*

It took me a lot longer than I thought it would to finish the easy assignment, and I also ran into the same issue as I was starting this hard one. I started with the header and footer in the html docs and styled them for a few days and still didn't get close to finishing them. I tried quite a few methods for the header, which is the thing I ran into that threw me for the biggest loop. I know the About Me, Portfolio and Contact pages are all missing the bulk of their content. I still have quite a bit of practice to do!
